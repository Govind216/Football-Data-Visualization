# Football-Data-Visualization

Data analysis and machine learning methods are being applied to football player data in this endeavor. The individual attributes in the dataset, which comes from the game FIFA 22, include overall rating, potential, and a variety of abilities and attributes. Data visualization, correlation analysis, and machine learning methods like linear regression, SVM, Lasso, Ridge, decision trees, and LSTM are all included in the analysis. The objective is to investigate the connections between player characteristics and places and to make predictions about player positions using machine learning methods.

With a decision tree classifier and an LSTM neural network, it is possible to forecast player positions and investigate the connections between player characteristics and performance. The dataset used includes data on more than 18,000 players, as well as information on their potential rating, overall rating, and a number of other characteristics, including pace, shooting, and dribbling.

The relationships between various player attributes and performance were investigated using a variety of data visualization methods. Heatmaps, correlation matrices, and scatter graphs were some of these. To forecast the total player rating based on various attributes, machine learning algorithms including linear regression, SVR, Lasso, Ridge, and decision tree regression were used. In order to forecast player placements based on their attributes, decision tree classifiers and LSTM neural networks were used.

Utilizing data visualisation methods, it was possible to see intriguing correlations between different player characteristics and performance, such as the one between overall rating and potential rating. The decision tree regression model performed the best when it came to predicting player scores among the machine learning algorithms used. Based on the characteristics of the players, the decision tree classifier and LSTM neural network could successfully forecast their positions.

The scope of this project appears to be to develop machine learning models to forecast player performance and positions while also analyzing and visualising player-related data. Python tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow are used in the project, and web scraping is also used to collect data from online sources. As part of the undertaking, visualisations will be made to show the outcomes of the analysis and machine learning models of FIFA 2022 dataset
